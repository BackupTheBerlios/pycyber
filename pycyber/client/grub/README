HOW TO INSTALL

* Patch GRUB

$ tar -zxf grub-0.96.tar.gz
$ patch -p0 < grub-0.96-pycyber.diff 
patching file grub-0.96/netboot/etherboot.h
patching file grub-0.96/netboot/main.c
patching file grub-0.96/stage2/builtins.c

* Compile GRUB with ./configure && make

See ./configure --help for enabling support for your NICs.

* Install GRUB with make install

* Copy /usr/local/lib/grub/i386-pc/* to /grub of the partition
  which you will install GRUB.

* Write a menu listing. Use the 'udpauth' command, provided by
  the patch, for waiting for server authorization.

* Call grub and type:

root (hdX,Y)
setup (hdX)

Where hdX is the HD in whose MBR you will install GRUB, and hdX,Y
is the partition where the files you copied to /grub are.
